Project Title:
# Guess the Movie

Project Description: 
The program gives the user an image from a movie and 
prompts them to guess the movie title from a 
selection of 4 choices. It includes frames for a 
starting screen, multiple-choice questions, results
display, and a "wrong answer" notification.

Technologies Used:


- Java Swing: Used for creating a GUI.


- Java Collections: using ArrayList and List to deal 
with movie data and randomization.


- Java AWT: Utilized for image handling and manipulation.

Challenges Faced:


- GUI Layout: Designing the frames and adding components
was challenging as they had to be consistent with one
another and be user-friendly.

- Random Selection: This was the most challenging part
of the project as I had to make sure that no answer 
appeared twice per question and no question had an image
from a previous one.

Features for Future Implementation:

- Score Tracking: Implement a scoring system so user
performance is tracked and subsequently checked.
- Difficulty Levels: Introduce different difficulty
options that give the user more obscure shots from the
movie.
- Themed Levels: Sets of questions that are specifically
about a certain genre(action, sci-fi, comedy) or even
a specific movie franchise(Star Wars, Marvel, Mission:
Impossible)
- Enhanced UI: Improve the overall user interface and 
experience.

How to Install and Run the Project:
- Download the Java project files.
- Compile the code using a Java compiler.
- Run the compiled GuessTheMovieDemo class.

How to Use the Project:
- When started, the program presents an intro screen.
- Click "Start" to begin the game.
- Guess the movie from the displayed image by selecting 
the correct title from the given options.
- Continue answering until the game ends after 10 
questions and shows you the results.
